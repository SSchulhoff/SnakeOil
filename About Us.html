            We are a small locally owned non-profit created in 2014. We are located at 801 W 36th St. 
            We were originally created to help cancer patients and are proud to say we have donated over
            $5,000,000 to cancer patients across the country. Our goal is to reach $10,000,000 donated by 2030.
            Please help us reach this goal by buying or renaming a galaxy. You can find the available galaxies 
            on the page called <a href="Image Gallery.html">Image Gallery</a>.
